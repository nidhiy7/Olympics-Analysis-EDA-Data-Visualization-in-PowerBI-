# Olympics-Analysis-EDA-Data-Visualization-in-PowerBI-

# Project Description
In this Project I have analyze  dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 ..
## Roadmap
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>The dataset likely includes information about the countries that participated in each Olympic Games, as well as the number of athletes each country sent and the medals they won.</li>
<li>Using Power BI and SQL, you may have been able to create visualizations that show the countries' participation and performance over time, such as line charts or heatmaps.</li>
<Li>I WAS have also  able to compare countries' performances across different Olympic Games, or analyze the performance of specific sports or events.</li>
<Li>Some potential insights you could draw from this analysis might include identifying countries that consistently perform well or poorly, or trends in which countries are increasing or decreasing their participation or success in the Olympics over time.</li>
<Li>Overall, analyzing and visualizing a dataset of Olympic Games results using Power BI and SQL can provide valuable insights into the performance of different countries and athletes over time.</li>
